The nwg-iso project provides an ISO image built with [archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archiso), with additions to ensure a simple way to install [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), [sway](https://swaywm.org/) & [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) Wayland compositors, and the [nwg-shell](https://nwg-piotr.github.io/nwg-shell) toolbox.

The live environment comes with live sway & Hyprland sessions, so that you can test compositors 
and the shell before installation. It also contains the `installer` command, which is a simplified 
version of the interactive installation with the [archinstall](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall) script. Some must have stuff has 
already been pre-selected.
